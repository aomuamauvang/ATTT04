Level0: comment: g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6
Level1->2: F12 h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7
Level2->3: <img src="files/pixel.png"> -> get to link/files then get pass G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q
Level3->4: Not even Google find this -> meaning checking the /robot.txt file, then navigate to /s3cr3t and get the user info -> tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm
Level4->5: Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify Referal. Get pass: Z0NsrtIkJoKALBCLi5eqFfcRN82Au2oD
Level5->6: Use Burp Suite to modify LoggedOn -> 1. Get pass: fOIvE0MDtPTgRhqmmvvAOt2EfXR6uQgR
Level6->7: View Source -> get to link/includes/secret.inc, we find $secret, submit to the form and get pass: jmxSiH3SP6Sonf8dv66ng8v1cIEdjXWr
Level7->8: By checking the hint: <!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->, we navigate to: http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -> pass is a6bZCNYwdKqN5cGP11ZdtPg0iImQQhAB
Level8->9: do the reverse way to get the key, after submiting we grab pass: Sda6t0vkOPkM8YeOZkAGVhFoaplvlJFd
Level9->10: since the input will do command "grep -i $key dictionary.txt"), which means if we input anything in the form, it will output as $key there. So just input ";cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10;", the command will be "grep -i ;cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10; dictionary.txt", and we grab what we need: D44EcsFkLxPIkAAKLosx8z3hxX1Z4MCE
Level10->11: similar to above, but they filter ; | &, so we cannot use ; or | or &.
Look into the code "grep -i $key dictionary.txt", and grep format is: grep [word] [file1] [file2] ... [filen], meaning if we put the $key as "[word] [file_to_search]", then we will find the pass. Tho we ain't sure what the password's character can be, just filter every word and digit: [wd] /etc/natas_webpass/natas11, so the command will be: "grep -i [wd] /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 dictionary.txt", we find it: 1KFqoJXi6hRaPluAmk8ESDW4fSysRoIg
Level11->12:
